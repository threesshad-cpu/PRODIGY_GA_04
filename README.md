## 🌐 Project Overview



**AI Facade Architect Pro** is a high-end image-to-image translation system built using a **Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (CGAN)** called **Pix2Pix**. 



The application specializes in architectural synthesis, taking **semantic label maps** (color-coded sketches) from the **CMP Facades dataset** and translating them into **photo-realistic building facades** in real-time. It demonstrates the power of adversarial training where a Generator and Discriminator compete to create authentic textures.



---



## 🚀 The Core Idea



Traditional architectural rendering requires massive manual effort to apply textures like stone, glass, or brick to a conceptual design. This project leverages **Generative AI** to automate the rendering process by learning the underlying relationship between architectural labels and pixel-level details.



**AI Facade Architect Pro** showcases:

- **Image-to-Image Mapping** using paired datasets.

- **U-Net Architecture** for preserving high-frequency spatial details.

- **Adversarial Learning** to generate sharp, non-blurry building outputs.

## ⚙️ How the System Works



### 1️⃣ Model Architecture

The system uses a **U-Net Generator** with skip connections that pass low-level information (like window edges) directly to the output layers to ensure structural accuracy.







---



### 2️⃣ Preprocessing

- Input images are resized to **256x256** pixels.

- Pixels are normalized to the range **[-1, 1]** to align with the Generator's **Tanh** activation layer.



---



### 3️⃣ Neural Synthesis

- The Generator receives the color-coded label map as a "condition".

- It synthesizes textures based on learned patterns from the CMP dataset (e.g., blue areas → glass windows).



---



### 4️⃣ Output Post-Processing

- The output is denormalized back to **[0, 255]**.

- **Image Enhancement** filters for Sharpness and Contrast are applied to ensure a crisp, photo-realistic final render.



---



## ✨ Key Features



### 🧠 Advanced CGAN Integration

- Custom loading logic to resolve **Keras 3.0 legacy metadata** issues (`quantization_mode` fix).

- Optimized for high-fidelity architectural translation.



---



### 🎨 Professional UI/UX

- **Animated Aurora Background**: A moving midnight-gradient that shifts diagonally for a "breathing" effect.

- **Compact Layout**: Uses centered glass containers and constrained image sizes for a sleek software look.



---



### 🎯 Interactive Demo

- **Sample Selection Sidebar**: Allows evaluators to test the model instantly with pre-loaded label maps.

- **Export Utility**: One-click download for high-definition renders.
